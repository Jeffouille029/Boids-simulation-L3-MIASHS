# Boids-simulation-L3-MIASHS
Developed as part of a TER, this project implements a Python-based simulation of **Boids** which is an artificial life algorithm to simulate collective animal behavior.
It also explores modern enhancements and optimization techniques such as spatial partitioning.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a realistic simulation of collective animal behavior using the Boids model. The goals include:
